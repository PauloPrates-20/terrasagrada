            "A whispergust mote is a sentient breath of air typically separated from a larger air elemental. When not invisible, its form resembles a dollop of blue whipped cream but is weightless and fluid to the touch. The mote can use an action to become invisible, but it typically only does so when it senses danger. When left to its own devices, the mote will gently tousle the hair of passing creatures or flip a fallen leaf. While it is a form that is defined by its wanderlust, it nevertheless enjoys the company and experiences of adventuring parties that travel to new and unique locations. Most owners of a whispergust mote are rarely so bold as to claim ownership of it at all.",

While you are attuned to the flute, ordinary snakes are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. For the purposes of this item, this includes flying snakes, poisonous snakes, and constrictor snakes, although swarms and giant versions of such creatures have a 50 percent chance of being indifferent to you instead.",

While you continue to play the flute each round as an action, any snake that comes within 30 feet of you and isn't under another creature's control must make a Wisdom check contested by your Charisma check. If you lose the contest, the snake behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the flute's music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the snake is swayed by the flute's music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the instrument. A friendly snake obeys your mental commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly snake, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly snake starts its turn and can't hear the flute's music, your control over that snake ends, and the snake behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the flute's music for the next 24 hours. Your control over a snake ends early if you or your companions do anything harmful to it."

While all hoarder's hauls: are made from the horns of dragons, their true magic stems from the strength of the dragon's greed. Uncommon and rare carts have handles and a single wheel at their front and must be physically moved. Very rare versions have a flying speed of 10 feet, can hover up to 20 feet off the ground, and move according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of the cart.",

The first command word can be spoken using an action and causes the cart to shrink or enlarge, becoming as small as 1 foot long and 7 inches across or as large as 5 feet long and 3 feet across. Regardless of its size, the cart always weighs 5 pounds without anything inside it.

A creature that attempts to remove an object locked in this way must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the cart for 1 minute. A frightened creature is unwilling to move toward the cart or interact with it for the duration. If the cart is a rare or very rare version, the creature also takes psychic damage on a failed saving throw. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours. You can speak the second command word as an action again to unlock any number of objects within the cart.",

            "This dark, bubbling poison is made from a rakshasa's magic-immune blood and tastes sweet and syrupy, despite its gruesome appearance. Each bottle contains one dose of the poison. A creature that ingests this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour. If the poisoned creature is a spellcaster, it takes an additional 4d6 psychic damage and can't cast cantrips until this poison ends. In addition, a poisoned spellcaster can only cast spells of 1st level or higher by using a spell slot at least 4 levels higher than the desired slot level, without the added benefits of using the higher spell slot level. For example, a poisoned spellcaster can cast the 2nd-level version of magic missile using a 6th-level spell slot. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much poison and psychic damage and isn't poisoned."

When a hostile creature enters this darkness for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 2d8 necrotic damage. If you roll an 8 on both of the damage dice for this effect, the creature becomes magically grappled by the aura's smoky tendrils. The creature remains grappled until it's no longer within the aura, or until it uses an action to make a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice), escaping the grapple on a success. The aura remains for 1 minute or until you die, are incapacitated, or end the effect early using a bonus action."

            "Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.",
            "A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.",

If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.",
            "A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used mythallars to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the mythallar, the more magic it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter.",

Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the Ythryn mythallar follows the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide.
